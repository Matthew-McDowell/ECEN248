WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net clk_div0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2/O, cell clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
